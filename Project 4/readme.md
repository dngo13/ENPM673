Optical Flow and Convolutional Neural Network

Problem 1

OpenCV 4.2, Python 3.7

For problem 1, open prj4_p1.py inside Spyder (preferred!) instead of running the file inside terminal. Run the program and it will ask for user input of 1 or 2, with 1 being Lucas Kanade, and 2 being optical flow. 1 is just for plotting the lines on the video frame, but it is very buggy. Option 2 is for the problem statement. It prepares background subtraction and calculates the optical flow on the video. The optical flow video is displayed. Note that you need to let this run completely until the video closes, so that the plotting of the vector field begins.

Problem 2

NEED tensorflow, keras, PIL, matplotlib, numpy

Open file in jupyter notebook cnn_prj4.ipynb

For Fish Dataset, needs to be in the folder where this notebook is. You need to manually adjust the directory (I didn't use Google Colab), but to make it more convenient please download the zip file and extract it to the folder where the notebook is.

Run all the cells minus the ones that say not to. Certain cells delete the ground truth folders. More detailed information is in the report.

Github link in case file does not run. This link contains the last results for submission.
